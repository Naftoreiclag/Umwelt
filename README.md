Umwelt
======
*Umwelt was an idea for a [Minecraft Forge](www.minecraftforge.net) mod that changed the way certain textures, models, etc... looked in [Minecraft](www.minecraft.net) while still allowing clients to connect to non-modified servers. Essentially, it was something like the popular "connected textures mod" that did pretty much the same thing, but in a slightly different way than what I had intended.* -Me, 2015
